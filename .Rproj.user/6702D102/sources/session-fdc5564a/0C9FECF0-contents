## Why Markdown?
- Plain text → **portable**, **future‑proof**, great with Git.
- One syntax for **reports** and **slides**.
- Plays nicely with **Quarto/R/Python** for reproducible workflows.
- Faster to write than GUIs; easy to **reuse** and **version**.

::: notes
Goal: sell the audience on “why”. Emphasize portability, version control, and reuse across reports/slides.

## Core syntax in 60 seconds
**Headings**
```
# H1
## H2
### H3
```

**Emphasis, lists, links, images**
```
*italic*  **bold**  `code`
- bullet
1. numbered
[link text](https://example.org)
![Alt text](img/plot.png)
```

**Line breaks**
- End a line with two spaces, or leave a blank line for new paragraph.

::: notes
Keep examples tiny; show how the same rules work in both reports and slides.
:::

---

## Code, figures & captions (Quarto)
Use code chunks. Quarto turns plots into figures with captions and cross‑refs.

```{r}
#| label: fig-cars
#| fig-cap: "Speed vs stopping distance (base R cars)"
plot(cars)
```

Refer to it in text: See @fig-cars.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-ex
#| tbl-cap: "Simple table"
import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame({"Species":["Adelie","Chinstrap"], "Count":[44, 37]})
```

::: notes
Explain chunk options: label, fig-cap/tbl-cap. Mention @fig- / @tbl- cross-refs.
:::

---

## Images & tables (pure Markdown)
**Image with alt text**
```
![Scatter of speed vs distance](img/cars.png)
```

**Table with alignment**
```
| Species   | Count |
|:----------|------:|
| Adelie    |    44 |
| Chinstrap |    37 |
```

Tips: keep alt text meaningful; align numbers to the right.

::: notes
Call out accessibility (alt text) and numeric alignment.
:::

---

## Math, citations & cross‑references
- Inline math: `$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$`
- Display math:
  $$
  \hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'y
  $$
- Add to YAML: `bibliography: refs.bib`
- Cite with `@key` and render a reference list.
- Cross‑refs: label figures/tables/code (`label:`) then reference with `@fig-...`, `@tbl-...`.

::: notes
If no bib file, say “you can add one later; the syntax stays the same.”

## From report to slides (and back)
**Report (HTML/PDF/Docx)**
```yaml
format:
  html:
    toc: true
    number-sections: true
```

**Slides (Reveal.js/Beamer/PPTX)**
```yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    slide-number: true
    code-copy: true
```
- New slide = `---`
- Speaker notes:
```
::: notes
Say this out loud.
:::
```

::: notes
Show how a single `.qmd` can target different outputs by switching `format`.
:::

---

## Workflow tips (checklist)
- Know your **headings**; one H1 per document/deck.
- Use **short lines** (≤80 chars) for cleaner diffs.
- Keep figures reproducible via chunks; avoid manual copy‑paste.
- Write **captions** that explain the “so what”.
- Use **styles** via YAML/format instead of inline HTML.
- Proof once, then **render to PDF** (reports) or **present** (slides).

::: notes
If time’s tight, just hit the first four bullets.
:::

---

## TL;DR
- Markdown = fast, portable, reproducible.
- Quarto turns it into polished **reports** and **slides**.
- Learn the 20% that covers 80% of cases: headings, lists, code chunks, figures, tables, math.
