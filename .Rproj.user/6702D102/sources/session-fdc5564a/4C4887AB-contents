**Two-sentense summary**: Australia has serious geographical inequality in access to childcare and over one-third of Australians live in "childcare deserts". The article starts with an family story and show interactive maps to show deserts concentrate on city fringes and regional areas while "oases" cluster in wealthier inner suburbs in large cities.

**Lede**: After Caitlin and Jonathon moving to Armidale, they struggled for childcare.

**Background**: What the Mitchell Institute measured; Why access matters for work, equity and early learning.

**Main result**: National maps +key numbers. The maps have straightforward illustrated the inequality of children care access.

## Piece 2 — List B(Blog post)

**Title**: How does ChatGPT work? As explained by the ChatGPT team — The Pragmatic Engineer.

**Link：**<https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/scaling-chatgpt?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com>

**Two sentence summary:** This post is a Q&A with an OpenAI engineering explaining how ChatGPT works. It uses respond pipelines and five-step graphs to demystify large language models for the general people.

**Background:** Who the interviewee is; Definitions and functions of tokens /embeddings /models.

**Lede**: Author prepares the interview and launch it with the form of Q&A.

**Main result**: Five steps of pipelines(input, tokenisations , embeddings , matrix , multisampling); Pretraining and inference

**Summary:** How ChatGPT works isn’t magic, and is worth understanding. The post also appends some links and caveats.

## Piece 3  — List C(Video)

**Title** : Why I fell in love with monster prime numbers —–Adam Spencer(TED)

## Combined reflection 

### Difference

1.  **Openings:** News initiated with an empathetic vignette; the blog starts with an authority hand-off; the talk uses performance energy.
2.  **Summaries:** The news use a interactive map to illustrate the conclusion; the blog post uses five steps of pipelines to show how LLM works; the Ted talk use stage visuals and narratives in the stage.

### Reasons for difference

1.  News faces the mass and it needs vignette to attract the attention and maps to indicate the inequality in childcare access straightforwardly. Readers could get conclusions by reading the heat map. Lastly, at the end of the article we could input our post code, and then the scarcity of childcare resources will appear.

2.  Blog post's readers are mostly followers, who are general people, not experts in LLM. So the introduction of the interviewee could improve its authority and schematics could separate the steps how LLM works. Most importantly, the post blog break the process into plain words. It's easier for readers to remember the process. The Ted talk introduced many concepts and narratives to make the abstract concepts like prime number concrete. The stage could help impress the audience. Compared to the previous two forms, it reduced the audiences' cognitive burden.
